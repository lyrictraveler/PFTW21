    <h1>About Welling Hall</h1>
    <div class="bio-container">
      <p>Welling Hall created <a href="http://legacy.earlham.edu/~wellingh/wpea/">her first website in 1994.</a> She quickly came to believe that the World Wide Web would tranform international communications. For several years after that, she taught HTML (CSS was not quite yet a thing) to undergraduates in her International Relations classes. She took a 25 year hiatus from web design because not everyone agreed that web design was a top priority for students of world politics.</p>
      
      <p>Recently she has returned to web development and design with the goal of making web experiences available, rewarding, and fun for elders. Join her in the adventure of elder friendly design!</p>
