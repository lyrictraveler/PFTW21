We 
want 
all 
beautiful 
creatures
to 
reproduce 
themselves 
so 
that 
beauty’s 
flower 
will 
not 
die 
out; 
but 
as 
an 
old 
man 
dies 
in 
time, 
he 
leaves 
a 
young heir 
to carry on 
his memory. 
But you, 
concerned only 
with your own beautiful eyes, 
feed the bright light of life with self-regarding fuel, 
making beauty shallow 
by your preoccupation with your looks. 
In this you are your own enemy, 
being cruel to yourself. 
You who are the world’s most beautiful ornament and the chief messenger of spring, are burying your gifts within yourself 
And, dear selfish one, 
because you decline to reproduce, 
you are actually wasting that beauty. 
Take pity on the world or else be the glutton who devours, with the grave, what belongs to the world.
